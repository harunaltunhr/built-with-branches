    <p>If you are unemployed, looking for a new challenge or can’t find the skills you need for your company the
      European Job Days could be for you. Onsite or online, these Europe-wide recruitment fairs match jobseekers with
      employers in other European countries. Participants also get practical advice about living and working
      abroad.<br>Hundreds of Job Days take place each year in 32 countries. Employers get access to thousands of CVs for
      free whilst jobseekers get to apply for jobs across Europe in a variety of sectors – from medicine to tourism.
      Whether
      you are an experienced radiologist or a young person looking for an adventure in another country, the Job Days
      could have something to offer you.<br>
      You don’t have to be physically present at an event to get the benefits. Thanks to online chat tools and
      livestreaming you can ‘attend’ a Job Day from the comfort of your own home or office and even interview online.
      European Job Days are run by EURES, a network of European Employment Services, and the European Commission.</p>
